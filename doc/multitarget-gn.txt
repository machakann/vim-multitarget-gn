INTRODUCTION				*multitarget-gn-introduction*

This plugin provides yet another |gn| command taking a count as a number of
operation. Suppose that you wanted to delete all "foo" from your buffer. >
	foo bar
	bar foo
	foo bar
<
You had searched the targets like "/foo<CR>" and now the cursor was at the
first column of the first line.
Then, could you tell what happen if you typed "3dgn"? The answer is here. >
	foo bar
	bar foo
	bar
<
Yes, it should be. However, someone might expect like this. >
	 bar
	bar 
	 bar
<

This is it.
